## üìÑ Project Overview

This project integrates **sentiment analysis** and **time-series forecasting** to predict cryptocurrency market trends, with a focus on Bitcoin (BTC). It gathers real-time sentiment from multiple news sources and combines it with historical price data to generate actionable trading signals (BUY/HOLD) through a fully automated pipeline and dashboard.

## üîç Problem Statement

Traditional crypto forecasting models focus mainly on historical prices and technical indicators, ignoring **real-time sentiment.** This gap limits the ability to respond to sudden market-moving news events. The goal here is to build a system that blends **natural language sentiment analysis** with **price forecasting models** to enhance prediction accuracy and responsiveness.
